            <li >Css stnads for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
            <li>Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
            <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not neccesary.</span><span style="background-color:yellow;">Css saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all once</li>
            <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li>
            <h2 class="css1">CSS can be added in HTML documents</h2>
        </ol>
        <ul class="spac">
            <li >Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial 
            we will use inline and internal styles, </span> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>

            When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applied a style to multiple elements. ID, on other hand, applies 
            a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used 
            by JavaScript.<br><br>
            In CSS,Selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a 
            style or set of styles can be applied to the element. <br><br>
            There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which 
            a style should be applied.
